# shc-internships
#### a bare-bones site for shc student internships
This is the source code for my website. There is no functioning domain at the moment, but I will put something up once I get a solid draft of the site's design.

## Purpose
Create a place where students at SHCP can look to find internship opportunities, without the hassle of searching, reading, and hoping that you found the right one, and without the often-necessary requirement of family connections. 

## Branches
The `main` branch is for the basic html/css. I am waiting to merge my commits to the other branches (that add JS and more CSS functionality and actually make the site work) until things look like they are working.
