# shc-internships
#### a bare-bones site for shc student internships
This is the source code for my website. There is no functioning domain at the moment, but I will put something up once I get a solid draft of the site's design.

## About this project
This is my 2020-2021 i2 project. It is my first web project with JS, so forgive any wildly inefficient/bloated solutions - I literally do not know any better. 

## Purpose
Create a place where students at SHCP can look to find internship opportunities, without the hassle of searching, reading, and hoping that you found the right one, and without the often-necessary requirement of family connections. 

## Branches
The `main` branch is for the basic html and styling CSS. The `development` branch is for in-progress changes; it doesn't work yet, so I'm waiting to merge the branches.

Update 2020-03-13: There's a prototype site now. The code is terrible, difficult to scale, looks bad, etc. but it's here. Proof-of-concept, I guess. I don't know what to use github for at all! love it
